Once you get past simple programs with one or two variables, you'll use data structures to store the values in your applications. Data structures are a lot like containersâ€”there's one for every way you want to store your data. While structures like arrays and queues are sometimes taken for granted, a deeper understanding is vital for any programmer who wants to know what's going on "under the hood" and understand how the choices they've made impact the performance and efficiency of their applications. In this course, Kathryn Hodge provides an in-depth overview of the most essential data structures for modern programming in Python. Starting with simple ways of grouping data, like arrays, lists, and tuples, Kathryn gradually introduces more complex data structures, such as dictionaries, sets, queues, and stacks. Each lesson is accompanied by a real-world, practical example that shows the data structures in action. Upon completing this course, you'll have a richer understanding of data structures and how to leverage them as you code.
